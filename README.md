# WeatherComparer

A Shiny App to compare weather from one year to a historical average over several years.

I'm a bit of weather geek and I often find myself saying "this January seems warmer than normal" or something similar (<https://andypicke.github.io/Summer-In-February/>). So I decided to make a Shiny app that will let you explore this type of question for different cities, months, and years.

Right now it only does temperature, but I am planning to expand it for other variables.

Data is from weather underground website. After clicking through to download some data once, it was easy to figure out the API from the url and modify it for different locations and time ranges.
